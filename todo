cron job - how? and do the copy to next day at midnight
    INSERT INTO DailyTodos (user_id, title, type, date, status, goal, created_at, updated_at)
    SELECT user_id, title, type, '2024-06-18', 0, goal, NOW(), NOW()
    FROM DailyTodos
    WHERE date = '2024-06-17';

set timezone on database/golang so times are what i want
    save in db per user. let you select on UI (basically controls midnight rollover)

enter your mission goals vision
    save to db. save to files, and send to ai

bg info - why each todo is relevant to your goals, mission, vision
    ai can use this

enter notes next to todo items, like oh flying day couldn't hit gym. eid day couldn't do gym. etc

every user gets their own ai agent
    ai encouragement daily
    send you cool youtube videos - of people like kobe
    enforce your vision
    great job 7 day streak
    tune ai to be useful
    ai reads your mission, goals, why each item is important to you/your mission. sees your progress (has tools to fetch your history, he can search any day of the past to see what you've done)
        youtube api app to find you cool videos relevant to you

daily journal - enter text. ai uses that too.

allow user to reorder their todo list as they like, save that state and keep it on copy

reflect on the day - good, could improve upon. what are you grateful for.
    it's time to reflect
    ai turns off your laptop lol, and you have to reflect
    ai runs your life, but you tell it how to run your life, and you also achieve all your goals. and you can always tell it to stop today. go to sleep ai, we'll pick it up another day
        every half hour
        less emotional human decisions. robotic ai sets the intention for each half hour, you just execute
            and allow for breaks. and allow for unexpected things, surprises, etc

hello raza greeting, it's 10:51pm. for any time related things, show a message. close your laptop in 10 min :)
    every time you hit the site, AI has something for you :D
        knows your goals, knows your past days activities, knows your actions today
        has memory of notable events, and references them
