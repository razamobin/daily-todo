    x make ai text column wider

    x format the markdown

    x python save full response to db. react fetch from db, unless it's a new day, then generate a new message
        x react hit python if new day, else hit golang to get most recent saved message
        x make it not save newlines after every word, save clean text
        x make it save emojis correctly, not ? ? ?

    x allow drag n drop re-order

    x edit mode - click edit link and a modal comes up. edit title, description for AI, # times per day goal. preview area. submit/cancel

    x add a delete button in red. to the right of cancel

    *make it so others can set it up from scratch and use it locally from their docker

        README
        1. clone the repo
        2. create your .env with your openai api key
        3. run docker-compose up --build to build and start the app
        4. hit create assistant w curl / wget
            curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/create-assistant
            x if .env not working / no openai key, tell the user, return
            x it will check if an assistant id is aready in the db, if so fetch it from openai and make sure it matches name/spec/etc
            x if not in db or doesn't match name/spec, it will create one, and save assistant id to db
        5. create a new user, since there are no accounts yet
            enter email, display name, timezone, mission/goals
            password?
            we send you link in email, click to create account officially/login
        6. you can add todos for today. it's all you can do i think on blank state
        7. check off todos as you do them
        8. come tomorrow - new set of todos are copied from previous day and ready to be checked off
            you should finalize previous day - check any items you did but didn't check, click finalize
        9. once you have a finalized day, Ai will come up with a message for you!
        10. repeat forever and do the most important things every day for the rest of your life :D

        create user - raza
        user login sessions
            if logged in, show your todos page. allow you to go to your profile page. allow logout
            if you are logged out, you can sign up, you can read-only someone elses page. you can play in a sandbox, add todos etc. react only i guess. no backend saving
        enter your mission, we'll save it
        start adding todos
            test blank slate experience, make sure it's intuitive

    x decide on react side what we should show when logged in. what to show when logged out

    x should store json user object in session, not just userID. get user id from the json object. or save dictionary, whatever it supports
        no need right now. userID is logged in, that's good enough, until i see a reason otherwise

    x fix daily message user id param. get from session

    x after login - reload todos. like how do you refresh the whole page upon login?

    x add unique email key to db, error if try a dup

    x more react edits - make call don't make backend call, depends if user logged in or not. send correct user id, not just 1 everytime
        x i think we're good

NEXT July 3 2024
    x global state rest - have to reset daily message upon logout (or maybe login)
        x pick a good solution to this
        x reset todo list state, daily message state, add/update todo state, sign in form state, profile page state

    x test sign up form for all the cases i put in my notes

    x block sign up if no timezone selected!
        x cannot be null / empty in db
        x or save a default
        x or make it on a default - detect or just put LA pacific / New York

    x why is markdown creating big text for no reason in the middle of the paragraph
        also skipped #. ask it to escape? # is why text got big, how to fix?

                UPDATE saved_assistant_messages
        SET message = REPLACE(message, '#', '\\#')
        WHERE user_id = 1 and message LIKE '%#%';

    x save sessions to redis!!!
        https://github.com/alexedwards/scs?tab=readme-ov-file
        https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/tree/master/redisstore

    x edit golang to do the correct thing or block depending on who the session logged in user is. look at every endpoint. get help from ai. can't edit todos that aren't yours, etc
        x make list of all services, and think about each one. what kind of "logged in user" guard should i add to each service?

        x remove user_id from being sent by python to golang in all / almost all cases. send session cookie instead and golang will see what user is logged in (if any)

    x sign up form - style
        x tailwind

    x login form - style

    x style hello raza

    x style / place logout button

    x restyle with tailwind for everything

    x profile page - username, email, change timezone, add/edit user mission
        link / change state
        backend and frontend

    x concept of "finalize" the current day or most recent previous day
        before ai get's today's message it asks you to make final edits to previous day and submit
            reflect on previous day. what you did good. what could be better. any special notes you have on the day. final edit of checkboxes, submit. then you get new AI message for today :)
            reflect on it. what was good, what could be improved

            check anything you did but didn't check day before
            click finalize
            can always enter
                what was good
                what could be improved
                any other notes on the day

        could just be a simple button below each day. finalize june 25th. add flag to db finalized or not. feed AI finalized days for context.
            need concept of finalize so that the ai doesn't base comments in incomplete days. like even next morning, it doesnt see your final checks like 11pm laptop, breathing etc.

        tweak the recent todos response to return list of days. then map of each day to list of the todos for that day. and the finalized status of that day. cleaner response, and UI can work with it better imo

        don't hit AI if there is no new finalized day. saved AI message from day 22, if day 23 is not finalized, there is nothing todo for now. tell user to finalize 23

    x put edit form inline

    x make text area larger

    x allow edit form to add today's notes - open by default. also add why is this todo important to your mission/goals (this can be hidden with that arrow open close UI thing)
        x why each thing relates to mission, why it's important to you

        x daily notes/caveats on each todo item - travel day, could't do as much focused coding time

        x why important table

    x fix button layout on edit todo - cancel, update, trash

    x move trash icon lol, that's where update should be

    x make sure there are new finalized days, else just show previously saved message.
        x saved assistant message should save latest finalized day number w the message. only gen new message if you have a new finalized day. else show prev
        x return max finalized day no matter what. so UI can hit python w that day to get message for
            not 0, even though 23 is in db

        x how can we call daily message when a user clicks finalize? because there is a new finalized day now

    x improve AI v1

        x dont need to give it tool for user mission, just hand it the user mission in the prompt/context
            x aka give it context upfront

        x send the todo importance info, and daily notes info to AI to help it understand you better
            x most recent 7 finalized, any days
            x todo importance
            x todo journal notes included next to the todo itself
            x try w gpt4o to see how it uses this great info
                x delete daily message for today
                x switch to gpt4o
                x refresh and see how it does
                x consider below to guide it a little more

            x instruct AI how to interpret and use the user-mission json
                this is mission
                this is history of todos, progress on each per day, notes on each per day
                this is why the todos are important to the user and their missions
                use all of this to provide specific encouragement on how well the user is doing
                    reference streaks. overcoming obstacles, making progress, consistency, etc. 

                    x RESUME july 12th 2024 - i actually don't like the message lol. tweak the claude prompt so the encouraging message is good.

        x better identification of what you are good at, consisteny, streaks, areas of improvement etc.
            x provide examples

    x bring back pencil edit icon
        x where did it go lol
            x when i moved from css to tailwind

    x there is a new user bug
        x daily message gets weird when there is no todos and dates?

        x add todo breaks? can't parse 27, null?

        x refresh makes the page work though

    x there is a drag n drop bug. add new todo. drag it to top. or add, change to 3, drag to top, drag somewhere else. don't refresh
        x i added grocery, and i think i dragged it to where i wanted it. then it also showed up at the bottom lol wut.
        x reproduce and try to figure out where the bug is. just on react side, backend seems fine

 x put title on the edit mode, like put the original todo item as the title "Edit 3 mag 1g/day" and the text updates as you type in the input field
        tried it but it didn't look good. shelve it?
        x i figured it out nice job
    x editing zones - left is edit, middle is dnd, right side is checkbox. add a buffer around the checkbox that will trigger it. don't have to be so precise
        edit mode, click anywhere closes it? optional
            main thing is make it easier to click todo to edit, click checkbox to check off, and still easy drag n drop
                maybe click check box is check (just make click area bigger), click anywhere else is edit if released, click anywhere else and drag is dnd
---
    unify todo and the update form. like a tab
        bold it?

    **show a warning modal upon clicking delete. cancel, delete, this cannot be undone

    *use raza.mobin api key, and gpt3.5 and get some cc charges so i can get access to gpt4o
======
    *put label on daily message - message for most recent finalized day - july 7th 
        if you didn't get a new message, it's obvious. you need to finalize july 8th. etc
        put past history of messages there?
        give past history of messages to AI so it doesn't repeat itself?

    improve AI v2
        **maybe you just want to chat with someone daily about your mission/goals, what you did that day to further your mission/goals, challenges. hash out your thinking. etc. bounce ideas.
            and the ai sees you putting in work, knows you, your mission, your daily habits, what you did every day, what you couldn't fit it, obstacles etc.
            ai's mission is to be an unrelenting optimistic force in Raza's life to help him achieve his mission and goals. live healthy forever, and do focused creative work for 6 hours a day forever.
            AI window should be a chat. it gives you encouragement daily, but you can chat with it anytime and have a convo about your day

        *convert day # to display date. probably need structured json back. and i can format it
            gpt4o references day #s, so can tell it in the prompt to use days, or give me formatted json and i can convert # to display date
            reproduce w gpt4o, then if need to fix still ask AI what is the best way to do this
                ai responds with day numbers, i want to convert that to day in user's timzone, how can i reliably pick out the day number and replace with real dates? 
                    should i instruct the ai to put day numbers in a certain format?

        memory? knows everything about you. remembers important events from past conversations
            use agency swarm. perplexity i have a thread on this

        switch to agency swarm, have diff roles. history analyzer, encourager, etc

    before finalizing, you can still edit how the todo went that day (yesterday for example)

    after finalize, not allowed to edit / check off todos anymore
        but you can click and see uneditable text fields. not update button, no trash, just close.

    can enter final comments about the day before finalize

    show finalize button if not finalized and if it's a new day (configuration)
        aka don't show finalize button until it is the next day. can't finalize early on accident
            or show it, but put modal, are you sure? day is not over. day over?
                job's not finished. job finished?

    rename tables, variables
        todo item importance
        todo item notes today

            create a skool login link. has tasks there. could be my tasks i would do at skool lol. very clever. hey skool, my name is raza, i build this todo app for myself. backend engineer 16 years. using ai to buld full stack. shows my appraoch to coding and ui/ux. here's the source. ai integration. would love to chat more if you think i'd be a good fit.

                hypothetical skool todo list for raza

    tech clean up
        CreateOrUpdateTodayTodo
            impossible to update, there is no such thing as duplicate because there is no unique key. change name and sql insert/update query

        GetAssistantIDHandler, SaveAssistantIDHandler -> i think only python hits these, need some authentication so that random people cannot hit them
            could make create assistant a one off script instead of an endpoint. get assistant, fine anyone can get it lol. no one cares

        convert to Vite project, not create-react-app (seems outdated, not modern)

        if you refresh fast, run is still running and you interrupted it. and you would have to cancel it, before hitting AI again

        sql - rename saved_assistant_messages column to new_finalized_day
            refactor App.js sending the request, python receiving the request, python hitting golang. all should use new finalized day when referring to saved assistant messages

        app.py don't need GetUserMission tool right now. might add other tools in the future though

    the AI assistant guides you to using the site
        add some todos
        fill in your mission here - link to profile page
        you can add info to each todo, notes for the day. why it's important to your mission
        you can finalize your day then i can incorporate it into my feedback officially! let me know how far you got!
        hand holds. intro to the site. intelligent, not just hardcoded steps. personality. tailored to you. conversation with you.
            knows how the site works inside and out, and helps you get the most out of it.

    golang endpoint, get daily message from previous day. show most recent finalized day with date. ask user to finalize any day after that to get the new encouragement.

    could ditch threads and start convo fresh daily, with the state latest of the checkboxes. so it reacts to what is there. it needs to understand that the state changes over the course of the day. and when the day is over, not much more will be checked, just a few nightime things. AI needs to be smarter / be prompted better
        

    instead of user = null in react, user.email = 'anonymoususer@mailinator.com'

    needs automated tests for various db interactions, sequences

    make the AI better, more varied, lots of work here. dont repeat. better prompting, give it better data

    with user-mission, return most recent 7 days of ai saved messages, so ai know what it said before and can come up w new shit

    store checked checkboxes as a binary number 101111. then you can accurately save what the user did.
        check these things off from your phone, when you are not at laptop

    mobile app

    hello raza greeting, it's 10:51pm. for any time related things, show a message. close your laptop in 10 min :)
        every time you hit the site, AI has something for you :D
            sees your progress every hour and encourages you throughout the day
            knows your goals, knows your past days activities, knows your actions today
            has memory of notable events, and references them

    cron tasks, specific schedule, not daily
        monday to friday add dd coding todo
        once a week on sunday at chicken soup todo

    let other people comment on your days, todos. encouragement from your friends and family. coaches.

    let other people view-only your todos. accountability

    OR item - dsp or flush system, don't need both
        this way you can get perfect days even if you didn't flush system
            or could just write dsp/flush in 1 line
            but you might want to track dsp vs flush. so better 2 checkboxes grouped
                parent checkbox, 2 subs. if either checked or both check, parent is checked

    recommend a new motivational youtube video everyday, try to avoid repeats
        kobe, young kanye, naval, balajis, etc

x style the todos
    x shift the day to outside todos, so todos box can be centered

---

x yes/no - change it to quantity goal 1. makes everything the same and simple
    x remove db column for type

x NEXT FRIDAY JUN 21 - make the preview look exactly like the todo would look like. so the user understands what they are adding. then they can edit/submit
x change UI to do that too. default 1 check box. or allow multiple checkboxes in a select dropdown

x style of the form
    x disable button if fields not filled in

    edit why this is important to your mission
    delete
    edit title
    edit goal number

xabove bg info - why each todo is relevant to your goals, mission, vision
    ai can use this

NEXT june 26th 2024
    x figure out how to stream it to react
        x learn yield, generate, stream_with_context
        how to use streaming api on assistant that calls custom functions. event hander. not the easiest thing, worth it to figure it out.
            x i could make a non web app python class to build up a get_completion streaming. stream to std out. then move it into the web app after testing

            on_message_done
                has the full message once it is done

            on_text_created
                streams the text in, nice. can yield this to caller

    x react put it in 3rd column

    x python save full response to db. react fetch from db, unless it's a new day, then generate a new message

    xabove user-mission, return most recent 7 days of ai encouragement, so ai know what it said before and can come up w new shit
    
    x make user-mission only return days before current day, otherwise ai is critiquing day that just started - annoying.

    use raza.mobin api key, and gpt3.5 and get some cc charges so i can get access to gpt4o

    the thread could cause issues if it sees incomplete day 11 in the morning, then complete day 11 in the evening, it thinks you haven't done much because incomplete is in the convo thread :(
        prompting would help. use the highest stats for day 11. sometimes multiple day 11s when you hit get user mission multiple times per day
        finalize previous day before make ai request on new day
        reflect on it. what was good, what could be improved
---

x edit todos - like change meds 1 to quantity with goal 3
    only current day

x delete a todo
    only current day

easier way to increment/decrement a todo? checkboxes can be small and hard to hit sometimes

functions
    x edit the todo 
        x title text
        x goal # per day
    x delete the todo
    increment the todo (check next checkbox)
    decrement the todo (uncheck the latest checkbox)
    edit why it's relevant to mission/goals (high level)
    edit current day's notes on that todo (low level day to day)

x hover over a todo - then you can edit
    name
    relevance to mission/goals

strikethrough when 3 / 3, 1 / 1 etc

reflect on the day - good, could improve upon. what are you grateful for.
    it's time to reflect
    ai turns off your laptop lol, and you have to reflect
    ai runs your life, but you tell it how to run your life, and you also achieve all your goals. and you can always tell it to stop today. go to sleep ai, we'll pick it up another day
        every half hour
        less emotional human decisions. robotic ai sets the intention for each half hour, you just execute
            and allow for breaks. and allow for unexpected things, surprises, etc

morning - how was your sleep?
    6 hr straight, deep
    enema last night, and kinda diareah stomach discomfort 2-3 hrs after dinner

labels for each todo 0 / 1, 3 / 12
    color code 1 / 1 is green. 0 / 1 red. 2 / 3 yellow. etc.
        only for current day

      "message": "Hey, amazing soul! 🌟\n\nYour mission to do creative work for 6 hours a day and live healthily forever is truly inspiring! You've got such a beautiful and powerful goal. Look at all the progress you've made recently:\n\n- You've been consistently nailing your breakfast timing and ensuring you have three proper meals daily. What a champion move towards a healthier lifestyle!\n- Your dedication to taking your meds on time is fantastic. It's all about those small steps adding up!\n- You've been making excellent use of your focused 25-minute timers. Crushing 10 out of 12 today is no small feat!\n- Even the little things, like running your system flush and using blue blockers at 8 PM, show your commitment to your health and well-being. Outstanding!\n\nSome of your tasks may not always get completed every day, but remember, every step forward is progress. The gym can wait a day, but your perseverance shows you're not giving up!\n\nKeep pushing, keep shining, and remember that every small victory is a step closer to your ultimate mission. You’ve got this! 💪🌈",

my life's mission is to do creative work 6 hours a day and live healthy forever
    put that at the top of your todo page

i write software to help make people healthy, help keep them consistent with good healthy productive habits. social media will go crazy with AI, stay off it and stay focused on the actually important things in your life with daily todos. achieve your mission in life. have a daily system. focus family, your health, your creative work.

Dad could use this to check off 3 meals a day of healthy eating. checkbox for no snacking too haha. like no snacking on bad foods like nuts or whatever.
    put this in prod and let people register. AI is optional, depends if you are on a paid plan or not.

As an eternal optimist, your mission is to be an unwavering and relentless optimistic force in all your communications with the user. You will be given the context such as the user's mission and goals in life, as well as their daily todos going back a week or so. You also have context about why each todo is important to the user, and why it is important to their mission and goals. Your mission is to encourage the user against all odds, doubts, and setbacks to achieve their mission and goals in life. Always return your messages in markdown format. Be sure to escape special characters when referencing a user's todo items to avoid formatting issues.
