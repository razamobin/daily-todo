    edit goal number

bg info - why each todo is relevant to your goals, mission, vision
    ai can use this

every user gets their own ai agent
    ai encouragement daily
    send you cool youtube videos - of people like kobe
    enforce your vision
    great job 7 day streak
    tune ai to be useful
    ai reads your mission, goals, why each item is important to you/your mission. sees your progress (has tools to fetch your history, he can search any day of the past to see what you've done)

maybe you just want to chat with someone daily about your mission/goals, what you did that day to further your mission/goals, challenges. hash out your thinking. etc. bounce ideas.
    and the ai sees you putting in work, knows you, your mission, your daily habits, what you did every day, what you couldn't fit it, obstacles etc.

NEXT june 26th 2024
    x figure out how to stream it to react
        x learn yield, generate, stream_with_context
        how to use streaming api on assistant that calls custom functions. event hander. not the easiest thing, worth it to figure it out.
            x i could make a non web app python class to build up a get_completion streaming. stream to std out. then move it into the web app after testing

            on_message_done
                has the full message once it is done

            on_text_created
                streams the text in, nice. can yield this to caller

    x react put it in 3rd column

    python save full response to db. react fetch from db, unless it's a new day, then generate a new message

    user-mission, return most recent 7 days of ai encouragement, so ai know what it said before and can come up w new shit
    
    x make user-mission only return days before current day, otherwise ai is critiquing day that just started - annoying.

    use raza.mobin api key, and gpt3.5 and get some cc charges so i can get access to gpt4o

    the thread could cause issues if it sees incomplete day 11 in the morning, then complete day 11 in the evening, it thinks you haven't done much because incomplete is in the convo thread :(
        prompting would help. use the highest stats for day 11. sometimes multiple day 11s when you hit get user mission multiple times per day
        finalize previous day before make ai request on new day
        reflect on it. what was good, what could be improved
---

edit todos - like change meds 1 to quantity with goal 3
    only current day

delete a todo
    only current day

easier way to increment/decrement a todo? checkboxes can be small and hard to hit sometimes

functions
    edit the todo 
        title text
        goal # per day
    delete the todo
    increment the todo (check next checkbox)
    decrement the todo (uncheck the latest checkbox)
    edit why it's relevant to mission/goals (high level)
    edit current day's notes on that todo (low level day to day)

hover over a todo - then you can edit
    name
    relevance to mission/goals

strikethrough when 3 / 3, 1 / 1 etc
---

allow sign up

allow login/logout

show current time and timezone on UI, and let user change timezone

---

can update yday, but not before yday

---

allow user to reorder their todo list as they like, save that state and keep it on copy

---

reflect on the day - good, could improve upon. what are you grateful for.
    it's time to reflect
    ai turns off your laptop lol, and you have to reflect
    ai runs your life, but you tell it how to run your life, and you also achieve all your goals. and you can always tell it to stop today. go to sleep ai, we'll pick it up another day
        every half hour
        less emotional human decisions. robotic ai sets the intention for each half hour, you just execute
            and allow for breaks. and allow for unexpected things, surprises, etc

morning - how was your sleep?
    6 hr straight, deep
    enema last night, and kinda diareah stomach discomfort 2-3 hrs after dinner

hello raza greeting, it's 10:51pm. for any time related things, show a message. close your laptop in 10 min :)
    every time you hit the site, AI has something for you :D
        knows your goals, knows your past days activities, knows your actions today
        has memory of notable events, and references them

labels for each todo 0 / 1, 3 / 12
    color code 1 / 1 is green. 0 / 1 red. 2 / 3 yellow. etc.
        only for current day
